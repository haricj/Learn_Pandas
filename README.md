## Learning Pandas
Welcome to the Learn_Pandas project! This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. We are using the tutorials provided by TirendazAcademy, which can be found here (https://github.com/TirendazAcademy).
Please subscribe to the channel also : https://www.youtube.com/c/TirendazAcademy.
Both channel and the github repo has been very useful for me.
